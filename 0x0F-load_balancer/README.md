0x0F. Load balancer

## Overview

This project provides a simple and efficient solution for load balancing web traffic using Nginx. Nginx is a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server known for its high performance, scalability, and reliability. By utilizing Nginx's built-in load balancing capabilities, this project allows you to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, improving overall performance and ensuring high availability.

## Features

- Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers based on various algorithms, such as round-robin, IP hash, and least connections.
- Health checks: Regularly monitor the health of backend servers and remove or add servers to the load balancing pool based on their availability.
- SSL termination: Offload SSL encryption and decryption to the load balancer, reducing the workload on backend servers.
- Session persistence: Maintain session affinity by directing subsequent requests from a client to the same backend server.
- Dynamic reconfiguration: Modify the load balancer configuration without restarting or interrupting the service.
- Logging and monitoring: Generate detailed logs and metrics to monitor the performance and health of the load balancer and backend servers.

## Installation

1. Install Nginx: Follow the official Nginx installation instructions for your operating system.
2. Configure backend servers: Set up your backend servers and ensure they are running and accessible.
3. Configure Nginx load balancer: Modify the Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) to define the load balancing behavior, backend server addresses, and any additional settings.
4. Start Nginx: Launch the Nginx service with the updated configuration file.
5. Test the load balancer: Send requests to the load balancer and verify that traffic is distributed across the backend servers as expected.

## Configuration

The Nginx load balancer configuration can be found in the `nginx.conf` file. This file includes various sections and directives that allow you to customize the load balancing behavior. Some important configuration options include:

- `http` block: Defines the HTTP server context and contains settings related to load balancing, SSL termination, logging, and more.
- `upstream` block: Specifies the backend server addresses and load balancing algorithm.
- `server` block: Configures the listener and server-specific settings, such as SSL certificates and session persistence.

Make sure to review the Nginx documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the available configuration options and their usage.

## Usage

Once the Nginx load balancer is installed and configured, it will automatically start distributing incoming traffic across the defined backend servers. You can monitor the load balancer's performance, health, and logs to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

To modify the load balancer's configuration, update the `nginx.conf` file and then reload the Nginx service using the appropriate command for your operating system. The changes will take effect without any interruption to the service.
