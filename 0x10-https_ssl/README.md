Title: HTTPS SSL

Introduction

This project delves into the fundamentals of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), providing a clear understanding of how they work together to encrypt communication and ensure data security on the web.

What is HTTPS?

HTTPS is an evolution of HTTP, the protocol that underpins web communication.
It adds an essential layer of security by encrypting data transmission between a web server and a client (browser, app).
Encryption scrambles data, making it unreadable by anyone intercepting it.
HTTPS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information exchanged online.
How HTTPS Works with SSL

When a client (browser) requests a secure connection to an HTTPS website, the following steps occur:
The client initiates a connection to the server.
The server sends an SSL certificate containing the server's public key.
The client verifies the certificate's authenticity (usually by checking a trusted Certificate Authority).
The client generates a secret session key and encrypts it with the server's public key.
The client sends the encrypted session key to the server.
Only the server's private key can decrypt the session key.
Both client and server now use the shared session key to encrypt all subsequent communication.
Benefits of HTTPS

Confidentiality: Protects sensitive data like login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal information from unauthorized access.
Integrity: Ensures that data hasn't been tampered with during transmission.
Authentication: Provides verification of the server's identity, preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
